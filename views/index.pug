    h1 My Portfolio

    p My Portfolio interactively shows users my (yes, MY) recently completed projects within the Full Stack JavaScript program. It's purpose is to demonstrate the different skills I've obtained and how the problems I've solved along the way have increased in difficulty. This portfolio is a project in of itself and will continue to grow over time as I continue to advance in my studies. The JavaScript learning curve was steep at first, but after sheer determination I am proud to display my hard work over these past months for you to enjoy. A special thank you to my teachers and peers. (Tristan)
